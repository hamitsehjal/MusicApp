## FOLDERS

1. ### *views* - this will be the location of the .html files that we will be using in our application
2. ### _public_ - this will be the location of the .css, client side .js & image files that we use in our application
3. ### *data* - this will be a temporary source of static data (JSON) for our application

### We use app.engine to match a specific view extension with a template engine. For example if you want to map all html view templates to a specific engine you would register it here.

### Async means asynchronous. It allows a program to run a function without freezing the entire program. This is done using the Async/Await keyword.

Async/Await makes it easier to write promises. The keyword ‘async’ before a function makes the function return a promise, always. And the keyword await is used inside async functions, which makes the program wait until the Promise resolves.

## OBJECTIVE
1. We are making a functioning web-based Music Application capable of responding to request for content, reacting predictably to errors and storing/retrieving user information and application data.
2. We will be studying how web browsers send data to and from a web server.
3. How we can ensure that our applications are scalable, secure and robust. 
4. We will also study methods of storing and retrieving data from a data store (SQL & NoSQL Databases)
5. How to manage state (ie: “logged-in”) information about users.
