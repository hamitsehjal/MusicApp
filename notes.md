## OBJECTIVE
1. We are making a functioning web-based Music Application capable of responding to request for content, reacting predictably to errors and storing/retrieving user information and application data.
2. We will be studying how web browsers send data to and from a web server.
3. How we can ensure that our applications are scalable, secure and robust. 
4. We will also study methods of storing and retrieving data from a data store (SQL & NoSQL Databases)
5. How to manage state (ie: “logged-in”) information about users.
